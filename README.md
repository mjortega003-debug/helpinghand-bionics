A machine-learning-driven mind-machine interface that translates EKG signals into robotic movement. It enables prosthetics or mechanical braces to respond to muscle intentâ€”like a forearm prosthetic controlled via brachial plexus signals or a strength-assist brace. Designed for affordability and accessibility.
